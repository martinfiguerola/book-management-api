# Book Management API üìö

A RESTful API for managing books, developed as part of my backend learning journey with **Spring Boot**.

## üöÄ Project Description

This project provides a basic book management system that allows CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on a catalog. It serves as a practical exercise to apply fundamental backend development concepts using the **Spring Boot** framework.

### Key Features:
- **Create Books:** Add a new book to the system with details such as title, author, publication year, and price.
- **List Books:** Retrieve all stored books or search for one by its ID.
- **Update Books:** Modify existing book information.
- **Delete Books:** Remove a book from the system.

## üéØ What I Learned

In this project, I developed key backend skills such as:
- Setting up a Spring Boot project from scratch.
- Using annotations like `@RestController`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` to follow the **MVC** pattern.
- Managing data with **Spring Data JPA** and querying a MySQL database.
